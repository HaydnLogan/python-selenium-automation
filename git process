Terminal commands:

ls -a    # to see all files, including hidden files
cat (and name of file, [tab to complete name]) to see text inside that file

pwd  # to see directory being worked.

mkdir  # make a new directory

**  PROCESS **
git pull
git status
git add .   ( to add all files)
git commit -m "message"
git status
git push

how to hide?
